This file if for #5 and 6, Once 1-4 are completeted we can use this

Report: #5. Version space learning algorithm is a good alternative for approximating the opponents moves. Our current
algorithm runs on a hypothesis at a time method that can cause runtime and storage issues. Version space learning
algorithm would only retain hypothesis that are not ruled out after shortening the list. In other words we assume the
the most likely scenarios are correct and we remove the least likely scenarios. This algorithm takes a set of all
hypotheses and returns a subset that are not empty or within a certain margin. Since this algorithm is incremental
backtracking is not necessary. We use generalization and specialization space to order our targeted set. When Version
space is called, taking the matrix as the example space, it sets V = to the set of all hypotheses. Then it checks if
V is empty, if not then it updates the set using Version_Space_Update, taking in V and the set of examples space.
V will then be compared to generalized set and specialized set and return a set of the best hypothesis.

DO NOT INCLUDE-needs work

We decided to set the G_set with xxxx boundaries.
We decided to set the S_set with xxxx boundaries.
